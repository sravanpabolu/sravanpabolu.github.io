1. Structs vs. Classes

    Try to use structs over classes when possible. They are safer in a multi-thread environment, faster, they have a default init method and many other benefits. But understand the difference and keep in mind that structs are a value type while classes are a reference type, meaning that each instance of a struct has its own unique copy of it, while each instance of a class has a reference to one single copy of the data.

1. Subscripts

        extension String {
            subscript(i: Int) -> String {
                return String(self[index(startIndex, offsetBy: i)])
            }
        }

    **Usage:**

        let str = "Hello, Playground!" 
        print("Letter at index 7 is \(str[7])")

    **Output:**

        Letter at index 7 is P
